## Message to the Team at Simple Viral Games

Hi Sourav and the Simple Viral Games Team,

I'm excited to share that I have completed the assignment with great enthusiasm and dedication. This project allowed me to dive deep into my knowledge of Next.js and React, and I thoroughly enjoyed the entire process. 

### My Approach:

1. **Project Setup**:
   - Initialized a Next.js project and set up the basic structure.
   - Configured the project with necessary dependencies like Formik for form handling and Yup for validation.

2. **Multi-Step Form Implementation**:
   - Created a seamless multi-step form flow that collects user information, allows plan selection, and offers additional services.
   - Implemented state management using React's `useState` to handle form data across different steps.

3. **Form Validation**:
   - Ensured robust validation for user inputs using Formik and Yup.
   - Provided user-friendly error messages to guide users through the process.

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Developed a responsive design to ensure a smooth user experience across various devices.
   - Used CSS modules for modular and scoped styling.

5. **Final Confirmation**:
   - Designed a final confirmation step that summarizes the user's choices and displays a thank you message upon successful submission.

### Key Learnings and Fun Elements:

- **Next.js and React**: Leveraged the power of Next.js for server-side rendering and React for building dynamic UI components. This combination enhanced the performance and responsiveness of the application.
- **Formik and Yup**: Enjoyed working with Formik and Yup for form handling and validation, making the user input process smooth and error-free.
- **CSS Modules**: Used CSS modules for better maintainability and scoped styling, which made the styling process enjoyable and efficient.

I have attached the completed project files and the link to the GitHub repository for your review. I am incredibly excited about the possibility of joining Simple Viral Games and contributing to your innovative projects. Thank you for this opportunity, and I look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,

Vedas Dixit
